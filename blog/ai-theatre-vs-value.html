            <div class="blog-post__meta">By WeTalkData &middot; 7 min read</div>

            <div class="blog-post__content">
                <p>
                    Every board deck in 2025 has an "AI strategy" slide. Every leadership offsite includes a session on "leveraging AI." And yet, most B2B companies I work with are stuck somewhere between curiosity and confusion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The problem isn't that AI doesn't work. <strong>The problem is that most companies are doing AI theatre</strong> &mdash; visible activity that looks like progress but delivers no measurable business value.
                </p>

                <h2>What AI Theatre Looks Like</h2>

                <p>
                    AI theatre has some very recognizable symptoms:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pilot purgatory:</strong> Multiple AI experiments running simultaneously, none reaching production, none with clear success criteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution looking for a problem:</strong> Teams start with "let's use AI for..." instead of "here's a business problem that AI could solve."</li>
                    <li><strong>The innovation team silo:</strong> An AI initiative lives in a separate team, disconnected from the people who'd actually use it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vendor-driven strategy:</strong> Your AI roadmap is essentially whatever your tech vendor is selling this quarter.</li>
                    <li><strong>No baseline, no measurement:</strong> Nobody measured the process before AI, so nobody can prove it's better after.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If you recognize three or more of these, you're doing AI theatre. Don't feel bad &mdash; most companies are. The question is what to do instead.
                </p>

                <h2>The 3&ndash;5 Places Framework</h2>

                <p>
                    Here's what I tell every client: <em>You don't need AI everywhere. You need it in the 3&ndash;5 places where it drives real, measurable value.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finding those places requires honest answers to three questions:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Where does your team spend time on repetitive, pattern-based work?</h3>

                <p>
                    AI is exceptionally good at tasks that are high-volume, pattern-based, and currently done by humans who'd rather be doing something else. Think data entry, lead scoring, first-draft content creation, or support ticket classification.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The key:</strong> the task needs to be well-defined enough that you can explain it in a paragraph. If your best employee can't describe the rules they follow, AI won't figure them out either.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Where is the cost of being wrong low?</h3>

                <p>
                    Start with use cases where AI mistakes are annoying, not catastrophic. A poorly scored lead wastes a sales rep's time. An AI-generated first draft needs heavy editing. These are recoverable situations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Don't start with pricing decisions, legal compliance, or anything customer-facing with no human review. The trust isn't there yet, and the risk isn't worth it for your first AI win.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Where do you have clean, accessible data?</h3>

                <p>
                    This is where most AI ambitions die. The use case is perfect, the team is eager, but the data is scattered across five systems, inconsistently formatted, and 40% incomplete.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Be brutally honest about your data readiness.</strong> The best AI use case with bad data will underperform a mediocre use case with clean data. Every time.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "AI doesn't fix bad data. It amplifies it &mdash; faster, at scale, and with the appearance of authority."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>A Practical Starting Point for B2B</h2>

                <p>
                    Based on what I see working across B2B SaaS, manufacturing, and professional services, here are the use cases that consistently deliver real value early:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Lead scoring and prioritization:</strong> Use historical deal data to rank incoming leads. Measurable, low-risk, high-impact on sales efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content first drafts:</strong> Generate initial versions of emails, proposals, and marketing copy. Saves 3&ndash;5 hours per person per week when done right.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer health scoring:</strong> Combine usage data, support tickets, and engagement signals to flag at-risk accounts before they churn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meeting summarization and CRM updates:</strong> Automatically capture and structure information from sales calls. Improves data quality while reducing admin burden.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal knowledge retrieval:</strong> Help teams find answers in existing documentation, playbooks, and past proposals. The ROI on reduced "Does anyone know where..." messages alone is significant.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>How to Run a Pilot That Actually Proves Something</h2>

                <p>
                    A good AI pilot has five characteristics:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A clear baseline:</strong> Measure the current process before AI touches it. Time spent, error rate, output volume, cost per unit &mdash; whatever matters.</li>
                    <li><strong>A defined success metric:</strong> "We'll consider this successful if X improves by Y% within Z weeks."</li>
                    <li><strong>A real team using it:</strong> Not a sandbox demo, not a prototype &mdash; actual employees using it in their actual workflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>A human in the loop:</strong> For your first pilots, always have a human reviewing AI output. This builds trust and catches errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>A kill switch:</strong> If it's not working after the defined period, stop. Learn from it. Move to the next use case. Not every pilot needs to succeed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>From Pilot to Scale</h2>

                <p>
                    The gap between a successful pilot and organization-wide adoption is where most companies stall. Scaling AI requires:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Executive sponsorship</strong> &mdash; not just approval, but active championing. <strong>Change management</strong> &mdash; people need to understand why this helps them, not just why it helps the company. <strong>Integration</strong> &mdash; AI tools that exist outside existing workflows don't get used. And <strong>iteration</strong> &mdash; your first version won't be perfect. Plan for continuous improvement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The companies that get AI right aren't the ones with the biggest budgets or the most advanced technology. They're the ones that start small, measure honestly, and scale what works.
                </p>
