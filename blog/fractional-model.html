            <h1 class="blog-post__title">The Fractional Model: Why B2B Companies Are Rethinking Full-Time Hires</h1>
            <div class="blog-post__meta">By WeTalkData &middot; 6 min read</div>

            <div class="blog-post__content">
                <p>
                    There's a growing gap in B2B companies that nobody talks about openly: <strong>the need for senior strategic guidance that doesn't justify a full-time hire</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You need someone who's done this before &mdash; someone who's built CRM systems, scaled revenue operations, or navigated AI adoption across multiple companies. But you don't need them 40 hours a week. Maybe not even 40 hours a month.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's where the fractional model comes in. And it's changing how growing B2B companies access expertise.
                </p>

                <h2>The Problem with the Traditional Model</h2>

                <p>
                    The traditional approach to getting strategic expertise has two options, and both have significant downsides:
                </p>

                <h3>Option A: Hire a Full-Time Senior Leader</h3>

                <p>
                    A VP of Revenue Operations, a Chief Digital Officer, a Head of AI Strategy. These roles command salaries of &euro;150k&ndash;250k+ in Western Europe, plus equity, benefits, and the 6&ndash;9 months it takes to find the right person.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For companies in the &euro;5M&ndash;50M revenue range, this is often hard to justify. You need the expertise, but you don't need it full-time. And the wrong hire at this level is catastrophically expensive &mdash; not just in salary, but in lost time, wrong decisions, and team disruption.
                </p>

                <h3>Option B: Hire a Consulting Firm</h3>

                <p>
                    Big consulting firms bring impressive slide decks and junior consultants. The partner who sold the project shows up for the kickoff and the final presentation. Everything in between is handled by analysts with 2&ndash;3 years of experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The deliverable is usually a strategy document that's thorough, well-researched, and sits in a shared drive untouched. <em>Strategy without execution support is expensive shelf-ware.</em>
                </p>

                <h2>What Fractional Advisory Actually Looks Like</h2>

                <p>
                    A fractional advisor is a senior expert who works with your company on a part-time, ongoing basis. Think of it as renting a seasoned brain instead of buying a full-time seat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In practice, a typical fractional engagement looks like this:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monthly rhythm:</strong> Regular working sessions (typically 2&ndash;4 days per month), not a one-off project with a start and end date.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embedded, not external:</strong> The fractional advisor joins your Slack, attends key meetings, knows your team by name. They're inside the context, not observing from outside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategy + execution:</strong> Not just telling you what to do, but helping you do it. Reviewing CRM configurations, joining vendor calls, coaching team leads, unblocking decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible scope:</strong> One month might focus heavily on CRM architecture. The next might shift to AI pilot design. The engagement adapts to what the business needs right now.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    "The best fractional relationships feel like having a trusted colleague on speed dial &mdash; someone who knows your business well enough to give advice that's actually actionable."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>When Fractional Makes Sense</h2>

                <p>
                    The fractional model isn't right for everyone. It works best when:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>You're between stages.</strong> Too mature for scrappy improvisation, not yet big enough for a full executive team. Typically &euro;5M&ndash;50M in revenue.</li>
                    <li><strong>You need expertise across domains.</strong> CRM, RevOps, AI, GTM &mdash; these areas are deeply interconnected. A fractional advisor who spans them provides better guidance than separate specialists in each.</li>
                    <li><strong>You need speed.</strong> A fractional advisor can start adding value in week one. No recruitment process, no onboarding curve, no 90-day ramp.</li>
                    <li><strong>You want accountability without dependency.</strong> A good fractional advisor builds your team's capability, not their own indispensability. The goal is to make the company stronger, not to create a permanent consulting contract.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>When Fractional Doesn't Make Sense</h2>

                <p>
                    To be fair, there are situations where fractional isn't the right answer:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You need someone full-time in the role.</strong> If the work requires daily management of a large team, you need a full-time hire.</li>
                    <li><strong>You need execution only, not strategy.</strong> If the strategy is clear and you just need hands to implement it, hire operators or contractors, not an advisor.</li>
                    <li><strong>You're not ready to act on advice.</strong> A fractional advisor only works if leadership is willing to make decisions and implement changes. If the advice will sit in a document, save your money.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How I Structure Fractional Engagements</h2>

                <p>
                    Every company is different, but my fractional advisory engagements typically follow this structure:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Month 1: Deep Dive.</strong> I spend the first month understanding your business, your team, your tech stack, and your biggest bottlenecks. This includes stakeholder interviews, system audits, and process mapping. By the end of month one, we have a shared understanding of what matters most.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Months 2&ndash;3: Quick Wins + Roadmap.</strong> We tackle the most impactful, fastest-to-implement changes while building a longer-term roadmap. This dual track ensures visible progress while maintaining strategic direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Month 4+: Ongoing Advisory.</strong> Regular working sessions focused on the roadmap. Priorities shift as the business evolves. I attend key meetings, review major decisions, and help coach your team to own the processes we build together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The engagement is month-to-month. No lock-in contracts. If it's not delivering value, either of us can end it. This keeps both sides honest and focused on results.
                </p>

                <h2>The Real Value</h2>

                <p>
                    The companies I work with don't hire me because they can't figure things out themselves. They hire me because <strong>having someone who's seen this before saves them time, money, and wrong turns</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've watched companies spend 18 months and six figures building a CRM architecture that I could have told them wouldn't work in the first conversation. I've seen AI pilots fail because nobody asked the data readiness question upfront. I've seen GTM strategies collapse because the RevOps foundation couldn't support them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A good fractional advisor doesn't just know what to do &mdash; they know what not to do. And in my experience, knowing what to avoid is often worth more than knowing what to build.
                </p>
