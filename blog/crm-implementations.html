            <div class="blog-post__content">
                <p>
                    After 20 years of helping B2B companies get their CRM right, I can tell you this with certainty: <strong>the problem is almost never the tool</strong>. It's not Salesforce, HubSpot, or Dynamics that's failing you. It's the process, the data, and the people around it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most CRM implementations follow a familiar pattern. Leadership gets excited about a new platform. IT or RevOps runs a migration. The team gets trained. And within six months, adoption drops, data quality declines, and everyone goes back to spreadsheets. Sound familiar?
                </p>

                <h2>The Three Root Causes</h2>

                <p>
                    In my experience, failed CRM implementations come down to three interconnected problems. Solving any one of them in isolation doesn't work &mdash; you have to address all three simultaneously.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Process Before Platform</h3>

                <p>
                    The most common mistake is choosing a CRM before understanding your processes. Teams buy the tool, then try to force their workflows into it. The result? A system that mirrors nobody's reality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>What works instead:</strong> Before you touch any platform, map your actual sales and customer success workflows. Not the ideal ones, not the ones in the playbook &mdash; the real ones that happen every day. Then design the CRM around those, simplifying where possible.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "A CRM should reflect how your team actually works, not how a consultant thinks they should work."
                </blockquote>

                <h3>2. Data Hygiene Is a Culture Problem</h3>

                <p>
                    Bad data kills CRM adoption faster than anything else. When reps can't trust what they see, they stop looking. When reports are inaccurate, leadership stops caring. The downward spiral begins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But data quality isn't a one-time cleanup project. It's a <em>cultural commitment</em>. It requires:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clear ownership:</strong> Every field, every object, every pipeline stage needs an owner who's accountable for its accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Validation at input:</strong> Catch bad data at the point of entry, not six months later in a quarterly review.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular audits:</strong> Monthly data quality reviews should be as normal as pipeline reviews.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visible consequences:</strong> Make it clear that data quality directly impacts forecasting, territory planning, and compensation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Adoption Is an Empathy Problem</h3>

                <p>
                    Here's what most implementations get wrong about adoption: they treat it as a training problem. "If we just train people better, they'll use the CRM." That's not how humans work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    People resist CRM because <strong>it doesn't give them anything back</strong>. It feels like data entry for someone else's benefit. The fix isn't more training &mdash; it's making the CRM genuinely useful for the person entering the data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Does your CRM help a sales rep close deals faster? Does it show a CS manager which accounts need attention right now? Does it give your marketing team real attribution data? If the answer is no, you have an empathy problem, not a training problem.
                </p>

                <h2>The Fix: A Framework That Works</h2>

                <p>
                    Over two decades, I've developed a straightforward framework for CRM implementations that stick. It's not revolutionary &mdash; it's just disciplined.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Audit first.</strong> Before any changes, understand what you have. Map processes, assess data quality, interview users at every level. This takes 2&ndash;4 weeks and saves months of rework.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplify ruthlessly.</strong> Most CRMs are over-configured. Remove every field, automation, and workflow that doesn't serve a clear business purpose. Less is dramatically more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design for the user, not the report.</strong> Build the day-to-day experience first. Reports and dashboards come from good data, and good data comes from adoption, and adoption comes from usefulness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implement in phases.</strong> Don't try to do everything at once. Start with your core pipeline, get that right, then expand. Each phase should deliver visible value within 30 days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Measure what matters.</strong> Track adoption metrics (login frequency, data entry rates, pipeline movement) alongside business outcomes. If adoption is high but results aren't improving, your process design needs work.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Real Impact</h2>

                <p>
                    When CRM works properly, the impact is transformative. Teams spend less time on admin and more time on selling. Leadership gets accurate forecasts. Marketing knows which channels actually drive revenue. Customer success catches at-risk accounts before they churn.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But "working properly" doesn't mean "perfectly configured." It means <strong>consistently used, reasonably clean, and genuinely useful</strong> to the people who interact with it every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's the standard I hold my clients to. Not CRM perfection &mdash; CRM that people actually use instead of tolerate.
                </p>
